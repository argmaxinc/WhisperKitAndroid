# WhisperKit Android (Beta)
</div>

WhisperKit Android brings Foundation Models On Device for Automatic Speech Recognition. It extends the performance and feature set of [WhisperKit](https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit) from Apple platforms to Android and Linux.  The current feature set is a subset of the iOS counterpart, 
but we are continuing to invest in Android and now welcome contributions from the community.

# Installation

<details>
  <summary> (Click to expand) </summary>

The following setup was tested on macOS 15.1.

1. Ensure you have the required build tools using:
```
make setup
```

2. Download Whisper models (<1.5GB) and auxiliary files
```
make download-models
```

3. Build development environment in Docker with all development tools (~12GB):
```
make env
```

The first time running `make env` command will take several minutes.

After the Docker image builds, the next time running `make env` will execute inside the Docker container right away.

You can use the following to rebuild the Docker image, if needed:
```
make rebuild-env
```

# Getting Started

<details>
  <summary> (Click to expand) </summary>

WhisperKit Android is a Whisper pipeline built on top of Tensorflow Lite (LiteRT) with a provided 
CLI interface via `whisperkit-cli`.  The library is built with a C API for Android and Linux.  Please 
note that as the library is currently in Beta, the C API is not yet stable.

1. Execute into the Docker build environment:
```
make env
```

2. Inside the Docker environment, build the `whisperkit-cli` CLI using (for Android and Linux):
```
make build [linux | qnn | gpu]
```

The QNN option builds WhisperKit with Qualcomm AI NPU support and the QNN TFLite delegate.
The 'gpu' option is the generic GPU backend for all Android devices from TFLite GPU delegate.
Linux builds are currently CPU-only.

3. Back on the host machine (outside Docker shell), push dependencies to the Android device:
```
make adb-push
```
You can reuse this target to push the `whisperkit-cli` if you rebuild it. Note that this is not necessary for Linux build.

4. Clean:
```
make clean [all]
```
With `all` option, it will conduct deep clean including open source components.

# CLI Run and Test

<details>
  <summary> (Click to expand) </summary>

1. Run test on with a sample audio. For Android:
```
make test
```
For linux:
```
make env
make test linux
```

2. Manually run `whisperkit-cli`:

Usage: 

```
whisperkit-cli transcribe --model-path /path/to/my/whisper_model --audio-path /path/to/my/audio_file.m4a --report --report-path /path/to/dump/report.json
```

For all options, run `whisperkit-cli --help`

For Android, log in via adb shell:
```
adb shell
cd /sdcard/argmax/tflite
export PATH=/data/local/tmp/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/data/local/tmp/lib
whisperkit-cli transcribe --model-path  /path/to/openai_whisper-base --audio-path /path/to/inputs/jfk_441khz.m4a
```

3. Sample execution output:
```
root@cf40510e9b93:/src/AXIE# ./build/linux/whisperkit-cli transcribe --model-path /src/AXIE/models/openai_whisper-small --audio-path /src/AXIE/test/jfk_441khz.m4a
